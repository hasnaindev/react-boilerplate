# React Boilerplate

This React boilerplate comes with ESLint, Stylelint, EditorConfig and WebPack. The boilerplate React App already has React-Router, React-Redux and Redux-DevTools setup.

Just run `npm i` to install all the dependencies and then `npm start` or `npm run dev` to start the development or `npm run build` when you want to build a production version.
